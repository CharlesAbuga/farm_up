# Farm Up Application

This is an application made for farmers to help them manage their livestock using various features such as scheduling feeds, vaccinations and also capturing quantity of produce. 

It enables farmers focus on more important farm activities as it is cumbersome to remember all activities without a proper management system.

The app utilizes Gemini API in the chat section to help farmers seek solutions to questions they may have.
